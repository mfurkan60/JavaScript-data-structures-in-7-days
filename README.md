## Introduction

This curriculum is designed for those who want to understand and apply the concept of data structures using the JavaScript programming language. Over the course of 7 days, you will start with basic data structures and explore more complex structures such as arrays, objects, stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, and graphs. Each day, you will be supported by theoretical information on the subject as well as practical code examples and application projects, so you will have the opportunity to apply what you have learned. Our goal is to develop your software development skills and increase your problem-solving abilities by learning the fundamentals of data structures in a solid way. We hope you enjoy this journey!

## Day 1: Arrays

In this section, we will delve into arrays, one of the most fundamental data structures in JavaScript. Arrays are ordered collections that can hold multiple values, allowing for efficient data storage and retrieval. We will explore various characteristics of arrays, such as their dynamic size, which enables them to grow or shrink as needed. Key operations such as addition (using methods like `push` and `unshift`), removal (using `pop` and `shift`), and traversal (using loops or methods like `forEach`) will be covered. We will also discuss common array methods, including `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`, which allow for powerful data manipulation and transformation.

## Day 3: Objects

Objects in JavaScript serve as versatile data structures that enable the storage of key-value pairs. This section will explore the significance of objects in organizing and managing data. We will discuss how to create objects using both object literals and constructors, as well as how to access and modify properties using dot notation and bracket notation. Additionally, we will cover methods that can be defined within objects, illustrating how encapsulation works in JavaScript. Use cases for objects will also be examined, such as representing real-world entities and configurations, providing a clear understanding of their practical applications.

## Day 4: Stacks and Queues

Stacks and queues are two essential data structures that manage data in specific orders. This section will introduce the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle of stacks, demonstrating how elements are added and removed from the top. Practical applications, such as undo functionalities in applications, will be discussed. Conversely, we will explore the First In First Out (FIFO) principle of queues, explaining how elements are added to the end and removed from the front. Real-world examples, such as print queues and task scheduling, will illustrate the usefulness of these data structures. We will also implement basic stack and queue functionalities to solidify understanding.

## Day 5: Linked Lists

Linked lists offer an alternative to arrays, providing a dynamic way to store and manage data. This section will compare singly linked lists with doubly linked lists, discussing their respective structures and advantages. We will explore operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal, emphasizing the flexibility of linked lists in managing data. A simple task management application will be implemented to illustrate how linked lists can efficiently manage tasks. By the end of this day, you will appreciate the benefits of linked lists, particularly in scenarios where frequent insertions and deletions are required.

## Day 6: Trees

Trees are hierarchical data structures that play a vital role in organizing and managing data efficiently. This section will introduce the components of trees, including roots, branches, and leaves, and focus specifically on binary trees, where each node has at most two children. We will explore essential operations such as insertion, deletion, and searching, as well as the concepts of tree traversal (in-order, pre-order, post-order). By understanding how trees can represent sorted data, you will see their practical applications in databases and file systems, and we will implement a simple binary tree to demonstrate these concepts.

## Day 7: Graphs

Graphs are powerful data structures used to represent relationships between objects. In this final section, we will explore the basic components of graphs, including nodes (vertices) and edges (connections). We will discuss the various types of graphs (directed, undirected, weighted, and unweighted) and their applications in real-world scenarios such as social networks and transportation systems. Key algorithms, such as Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS), will be introduced, showcasing their utility in traversing graphs. Finally, we will implement a simple graph model to represent a social network, allowing users to visualize and interact with their connections.

## Conclusion

By the end of this repository, you will have a solid understanding of key data structures in JavaScript, equipping you with the skills to apply these concepts in real-world applications. Feel free to contribute, suggest improvements, or reach out with any questions!
